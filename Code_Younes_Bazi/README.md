# Accelerometer  
This code is used to read the accelerometer data from a 10 DOF IMU sensor. The sensor used in this code is the ADXL345, which communicates via I2C protocol.  
We started by defining the variables to hold the outputs, roll, pitch, rollF, pitchF and the sensor's I2C address. In the setup function, the code initiates the serial communication and the wire library, then it configures the sensor to measuring mode by writing to the POWER_CTL register, we also did an offset calibration for the X,Y,Z-axis.  
In the loop function, the code reads the accelerometer data by starting a transmission to the sensor's address and writing to the ACCEL_XOUT_H register, then requesting 6 bytes of data, which represent the X, Y, Z values. Each axis value is stored in two registers, so the code reads two bytes for each axis and shifts the second byte 8 bits to the left to get the complete value. Then it divides the raw values by 256, to get the value in the range of +-2g according to the sensor's datasheet.  
Then it uses the atan function to calculate the roll and pitch angles, roll is the rotation around the X-axis and pitch is the rotation around the Y-axis. The code also applies a low-pass filter to the roll and pitch values by using a weighted average of the previous value and the current value.  
Finally, it prints the filtered roll and pitch values to the serial monitor. 
Please note that we used the 10 DOF IMU sensor and we wrote this code as the foundation for implementing stabilization through the application of PID control.  
# 3D visualization of the accelerometer.    
This code is used to create a 3D visualization of the accelerometer's orientation using a software called Processing 4. The code uses the Processing library to create a 3D object and rotate it according to the roll and pitch values received through the serial port.  
We start by importing the necessary libraries, processing.serial and java.awt.event.KeyEvent, and java.io.IOException. Then we define the variables for the serial communication, a string variable to hold the data received from the serial port, and two float variables for the roll and pitch values.  
In the setup function, the code sets the size of the window, initiates the serial communication, and specifies the serial port name and baud rate.  
In the draw function, the code sets the translation and background, then it displays the roll and pitch values on the screen. Then it rotates the 3D object according to the roll and pitch values, using the rotateX and rotateZ functions, and then it draws the 3D object (a box) with the label "POLYDOG" on it.  
The serialEvent function is called whenever new data is received through the serial port. It reads the data up to the newline character and assigns it to the "data" variable. Then it uses the split function to separate the roll and pitch values, which are received in the format "roll/pitch", and assigns them to the corresponding variables.  
You can see the results in the video inside the Processing 4 file.
