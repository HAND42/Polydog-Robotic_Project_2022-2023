# SESSION 11 OUTCOME REPORT
## Date: 07/02/2023
## Main event of the session: Converting the 3D model of the Polydog to an URDF file (Part 1) . 
During this session, we discovered a way to import the 3D model of the Polydog into Isaac Sim. In the beginning, we thought of importing the robot parts from fusion 360 into isaac sim. However, this process was time-consuming as we had to define each joint individually, which required a significant amount of effort and attention to detail. Fortunately, we discovered a new and more efficient way to import our 3D model into Isaac Sim. Instead of using Fusion 360 and defining each joint manually, we are going to convert the 3d model of the robot that my colleague worked on it on onshape to and URDF file and then importing it to isaac sim.

## URDF file   
What is URDF file ?  
URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is an XML file format that is used to describe the structure and kinematics of robots in robotics SIMULATION and visualization software packages. It defines the various links and joints of a robot, their properties, and their relationships. URDF files are widely used in robotics research and development. URDF was created in 2008 as part of the ROS (Robot Operating System) project, a widely used open-source software framework for robotics. It was designed to provide a standardized way to describe the physical properties of robots in ROS, allowing for easy sharing and re-use of robot models across different software packages and platforms. The development of URDF was led by Morgan Quigley, a roboticist at Stanford University, and it has since become a widely adopted standard in the robotics community. The purpose of URDF is to provide a machine-readable description of a robot's physical structure and kinematics, including its links, joints, and other physical properties. This information can be used by robotics software packages (such as Isaac Sim) for a variety of purposes, such as simulation, visualization, and control. By providing a standardized format for robot descriptions, URDF makes it easier for researchers and developers to share and collaborate on robot models, and to use existing robot models in their own projects.  
## Converting the 3d model of the Polydog on onshape to an URDF file  
We are going to use a software called onshape-to-robot on ubuntu in order to convert the 3d model of the polydog on onshape to an urdf file.  
Onshape-to-Robot is a plugin for the Onshape computer-aided design (CAD) software that enables users to generate Universal Robot Description Format (URDF) files for use with ROS (Robot Operating System) or Isaac sim. So after creating a 3d model of the robot in onshape, the plugin then extracts the necessary information from the CAD model and converts it into the format required by URDF.  

In conclusion, we have learned about the process of generating a URDF file using Onshape-to-Robot, but we are still in the process of learning how to use this software. However, we are committed to applying the knowledge we have gained to start converting our 3D model robot into a URDF file that can be used for simulation on Isaac Sim. We understand that this process will require some trial and error as we become more familiar with Onshape-to-Robot, but we are excited to start using this tool to create realistic simulations of our robot. We are confident that this process will be a valuable tool in our robot development process, and we look forward to continuing to learn and explore the capabilities of Onshape-to-Robot.
