## Main event of the session: Developing a New Plan for Programming the Polydog's Inverse Kinematics.  
During our recent sessions, we faced several challenges in simulating the Polydog, on Isaac Sim. After dedicating nearly two months to the project, we hit a roadblock and were unable to make significant progress. We discovered that our lack of knowledge in the ROS (Robot Operating System) field was hindering our ability to simulate Polydog effectively. In addition, with limited time left before the end of the semester, we realized that we needed to focus on accelerating our working rate and ensuring that Polydog could walk smoothly. As a result, we decided to shift our focus and begin working on developing the inverse kinematics code to program Polydog. In this report, we will outline the progress we have made in restarting from scratch and refining our inverse kinematics code for Polydog's movement.

This code is an implementation of the inverse kinematics algorithm for Polydog's leg movement. The purpose of inverse kinematics is to determine the angles required at each joint in the leg to reach a desired endpoint in 3D space. In this code, the endpoint is specified as a 3D point, represented by an array of three floating-point values (x, y, and z coordinates).
The code contains four functions, each corresponding to one of Polydog's legs (A, B, C, and D). Each function takes a 3D point as input and calculates the corresponding joint angles required to reach that point. The joint angles are calculated using trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent, as well as the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of each leg segment.
The variables l1, l2, l3, and l4 represent the length of each leg segment, which is specific to the robot's design. The variables Atheta1, Atheta2, and Atheta3 (and similarly for the other legs) represent the calculated joint angles required for leg A to reach the desired endpoint.
Overall, this code is an essential component of programming Polydog's movement, as it allows the robot to move its legs in a controlled and precise manner to achieve a desired endpoint.  

## Designing a Walking Plan for Smooth Movement of the Robot  
The plan to achieve a smoothly walking robot involves coordinating the movement of its legs. Specifically, we will move the two diagonal legs simultaneously. To achieve this, we will have the two foots move from point A to point B, which are 20 cm apart, but they will not go directly to point B. Instead, they will first move to point C, which is located midway between point A and point B and is 7-10 cm higher from the ground. After reaching point C, the legs will then proceed to point B. This method of movement will allow the robot to maintain balance and stability.
Once the two diagonal legs reach point B, the other two diagonal legs will begin the same movement pattern. Meanwhile, the servomotors of the first two diagonal legs will need to return to their initial angle, which was defined earlier. This process will continue as the robot moves, with each set of diagonal legs moving in unison, while the servomotors of the previous diagonal legs reset to their original position. Through this coordinated movement, we hope to achieve a smoothly walking robot that can navigate its environment with stability and grace.  

In conclusion, we have discussed the code for calculating the angles of the legs of a robot based on a desired point. We have also proposed a plan for smoothly walking the robot by moving the diagonal legs simultaneously and following a specific path. It is worth noting that we do not need to worry about writing the code to send the angles to the servomotors since it has already been written by my colleague Hugo Durand. With this in mind, we can focus on implementing the plan and ensuring that the robot walks smoothly and efficiently.
