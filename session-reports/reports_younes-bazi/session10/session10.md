# SESSION 10 OUTCOME REPORT

## Main event of the session: Simulating the polydog with Isaac Sim .
In this session, we focused on simulating the polydog using Isaac Sim. The goal of the simulation was to develop the right inverse kinematic code for the robot dog, which would help us control its movements and actions in a more precise manner. By simulating the robot dog in a virtual environment (Isaac sim), we will be able to test and fine-tune the inverse kinematic code (even for the PID controller) without the need for physical prototypes.  
The use of simulation in robotics is becoming increasingly popular as it allows developers to save time and resources while also providing a safe environment to test their ideas and designs. With robotic simulation, we can quickly test and evaluate different control algorithms, sensor configurations, and physical parameters without risking damage to the real robot. This makes it a crucial tool in the development process of robotic systems.  
so during this session, I learned the basics of isaac sim using the [isaac sim documentation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html) , and i tried some robot simulations that already existed on the app, and there is among them a robot dog simulation:

We are not going to use this example to test our code because this robot dog is a little different than our robot dog, because the Polydog use a different system than this virtual robot dog which is the parallelogram system. So we are going to simulate the exact polydog on this app using the same measurments and the same legs model and that by importing the models from Fusion 360 to Isaac sim (the models must be in FBX or OBJ format). After that, we need to define the joints between the legs and the body by creating hinge or ball-and-socket joints in Isaac Sim. These joints will determine the movement of the legs and allow for realistic simulation. Then, we need to define the joint between the leg and the shoulder . This joint will allow the leg to move up and down and rotate. Next is the joint between the thigh and the shin by creating a hinge joint in Isaac Sim. This joint will allow the leg to bend and straighten. Afterwards, we must test the simulation by moving the joints and observing the movement of the legs. Iteratively adjust the joint parameters to achieve the desired motion and then we must repeat the steps for each leg and make sure all joints are properly defined and connected. And finally, we finish the simulation by fine-tuning the joint parameters, adding additional components (such as the body), and creating a control system to drive the robot.  
Unfortunately, we were unable to finish the simulation due to our lack of experience with the software. However, we are actively learning and making progress in our understanding of the platform. Moving forward, we will continue to work on our knowledge and skills to ultimately achieve a successful simulation of the robot.
