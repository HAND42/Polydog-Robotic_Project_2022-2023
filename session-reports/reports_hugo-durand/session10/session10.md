# Session 10 - Week 5

##### Polydog_v3 -- January 2023

## Oral presentation

We showed the advances of the robot. However, during the presentation two of the servo-motors failed. The next day, I booked a slot to print the servo horn with a better and more resistant resin. I disassembled the leg almost completely to be able to extract the servo horn from its place. 

The disassembly and reassembly took me quite some time, to get the robot back on its feet. The problem is that each time we disassemble the robot, we have to modify again the offsets so that the 4 legs are synchronized with each other.

## Feet

I tested putting sandpaper on the feet to make them grip the floor better. But I don't think that's the problem because the material is already good. Fred thought that maybe with the inclination of the leg, the contact surface on the ground is less important when the robot pushes forward creating a slippage of the foot. We should be able to replace the shape of the foot with a uniform ball so that the friction surface is the same over time, using small rubber balls that are not too hard to let the foot cushion itself on the ground.
