## Mathematics of the robot

I continued with the robot leg math. I modeled on EdrawMax the diagrams that allowed me to visualize the angles to be calculated.

I forced myself to redo the diagrams on a clean software because previously when I had done them by hand I had badly reproduced an angle, which gave me different results for the calculation of the gamma angle depending on the two starting configurations.I also find it much cleaner for a very certain re-reading by my next future self.

At the end here are the equations that allow me to find the coordinates of the leg (the point E) with respect to the point O :
